# Prototype
# installation
This project contains (1) a zipped java implementation called proj2 of our prototype and 
(2) a set of zip files corresponding to the htdocs directory of an apache server in which we deploy
all resources used by the prototype (mainly ontologies, service specifications and requests descriptions).
The installation of the prototype requires a previous installation of xampp (https://www.apachefriends.org/) at c:\ (root directory in drive c).
Then, (1) Download the whole project in zip format (from the button called Code). The downloaded project is a directory called prototypes-main, 
      (2) Unzip the zipped directory called prototypes-main in a temporal directory.
      (3) As we said, the result of (2) is a zipped java implementation called proj2 of our prototype and 
      a set of 1015 zip files corresponding to the htdocs directory of an apache server.
      (4) In a temporal directory, unzip the htdocs directory by unzipping the file called htdocs.zip (using for instance winrar or 7-zip programs). 
      This step generates an unzipped htdocs directory containing all resources used by the prototype in directories such as specifications, requests,
      ontologies, modules, repositories, ... etc) 
      (5) all resources (directories+ files) generated in (4) must be copied to the htdocs directory of the apache server (c:\xammp) previously installed 
      in your machine.
