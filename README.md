# prototype
This project contains (1) a zipped java implementation called proj2 of our prototype and 
(2) a set of zip files corresponding to the htdocs directory of an apache server in which we deploy
all resources used by the prototype (mainly ontologies, service specifications and requests descriptions).
The installation of the prototype requires a previous installation of xampp (https://www.apachefriends.org/) at c:\ (root directory in drive c).
Then, (1) download the whole project in zip format (from the button called Code). The downloaded project is a directory called prototype-main, 
      (2) unzip the zipped directory called prototype-main in a temporal directory.
