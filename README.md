Research prototypes
This project contains (1) a zipped java implementation called proj2 of our prototype and 
(2) a set of zip files corresponding to the htdocs directory of an apache server in which we deploy
all resources used by the prototype (mainly ontologies, service specifications and requests descriptions).
